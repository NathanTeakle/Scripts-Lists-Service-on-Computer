# Scripts | Lists Service on Computer

PowerShell Script that retrieves a list of all services (active or non active) on a computer, if you're trying to list services on an external computer (not the host computer) than you will need an elevated PowerShell terminal.

The script will need to be ran in PowerShell but opens an external GUI window for the user to interact with, making the retrieved list easier to read and creates an overall more pleasent user experience.
